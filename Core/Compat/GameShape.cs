    ///    rather than the square ring older builds swept. Wonderland compiles against this build, so
    ///    this is the native, statically-typed path.
    ///  - Legacy five-arg (0.221.12 with Vector2i sectors; the 0.221.13 playtest with Vector2s sectors):
    ///    FindSectorObjects(sector, int area, int distantArea, List&lt;ZDO&gt;, List&lt;ZDO&gt;). Reached purely by
    ///    reflection, passing the boxed sector object GetZone hands back straight through, so neither
    ///    sector type is ever named at compile time.
    ///
    /// The mono rule that dictates this layout (VALHEIM-1.0-MIGRATION-FACTS.md; TheEye's own
    /// Core/Compat/GameShape.cs is the workspace's worked example): a compile-time binding to a member
    /// the loaded assembly lacks throws at JIT of the CALLING method, taking the whole method down even
    /// with a try/catch inside it. So the native path lives in its own method that is only ever called -
    /// and therefore only ever JIT-compiled - once Detect() has confirmed the release shape, and Detect()
    /// itself compares type NAMES rather than using typeof() on anything that might be missing: a
    /// typeof(SimulationDistance) or typeof(Vector2s) inside Detect() would be exactly the binding the
    /// rule forbids on an older build.
    ///
    /// A second rule, learned live on VanillaBean (2026-09-09) when the Valheim10Compatibility patcher
    /// took Wonderland down: a patcher that bridges old mods onto 1.0 can inject its own same-name,
    /// same-parameter overload directly onto a native type (a legacy-return-type GetZone(Vector3) beside
    /// the native one, so old reflection-based callers still resolve it by that signature). Type.GetMethod
    /// (name, bindingFlags, binder, types, modifiers) - the single-result overload - throws
    /// AmbiguousMatchException the instant two methods share a name and parameter list, even though only
    /// one is real; it doesn't matter that the binder was given exact parameter types, because those two
    /// injected/native methods differ only in return type, which GetMethod does not use to disambiguate.
    /// So Detect() never calls that overload: every lookup goes through GetMethods() and is filtered and
    /// paired by hand, exactly like FindSectorObjects already was, and Release is tried against every
    /// GetZone candidate before Legacy so a shimmed build still prefers the native path.
